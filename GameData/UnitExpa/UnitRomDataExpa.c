it is reasonable to contributing patchs for this rather than 让FEBuilder适配这些功能。不过我没有在教程中找到如何提交patchs的教程，请问有关于提交个人patches的教程吗？或者我该提供哪些文件与哪些信息？

另外我希望的是其他人能够使用这一系统，自行定义技能列表等。我该做哪些工作，包括提供哪些信息等，从而让制作者有能力在apply patch的时候能够自行config呢？

it is reasonable to contributing patches for this rather than adapting FEBuilder to these features. But I did not find a tutorial on how to submit patches. Is there a tutorial on submitting individual patches? Or which documents and information should I provide to you?

What I want is that other people will be able to use the system, config their own skill lists, etc. What should I do, including what information to provide, so that the producer can configure it by himself when applying patch?
